ToDo List Application // React Native JS

This is a project for my internship at Hooli Software/MPH Intl.

This project was made possible using React Native js, Expo & EAS, Jotai, React Hook Forms, Zod, and ChatGPT 3.5 via GPT4All.

You can find all the files of the application in this repository.

You can also find the final build of the application at ./ToDo-List-App/ToDoListAPK/
